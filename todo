TODO

1. Database triggers
--> If Rent tenure over, send the data to OverRent table and delete from ActiveRent table
--> After A RentRequest is accepted then reject all other requests for that property during that tenure
--> If a property is rented out then it should not be available for rent for that tenure
--> As soon as Payment is done, update the status of the rent request to paid and add that price to earned in User
--> If an Item is deleted then delete all the requests for that item and update user to 0 which is pointing to NULL user to avoid foreign key constraint and deleting user renting history
--> Before Creating RentRequest, check if item is available for rent or not, if not then reject the request
