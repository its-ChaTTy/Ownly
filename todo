TODO

1. Database triggers
--> If a property is rented out then it should not be available for rent for that tenure [filtering]
--> As soon as Payment is done, update the status of the rent request to paid and add that price to earned in User

2. Cron
--> Daily check if any rent tenure is over, if yes then move that data to OverRent table and delete from ActiveRent table

DONE
