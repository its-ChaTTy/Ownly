      <p className='TC__title'>Terms & Conditions</p>
      <p className='TC__subheading'>1. Lender Specific Terms</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>1.1 This paragraph applies to you if you are a lender.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>1.2 You must not offer to lend through the OWNLY Service any firearms, weapons, pornography, mature content, animals or any items that it would be illegal to offer for hire in your or the borrower's country of residence. We may remove any items offered for hire from the OWNLY Service if we believe such items are illegal, immoral or damaging to our reputation.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>1.3 You are responsible for ensuring that:</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>(a) you have all necessary rights to hire out any items you advertise on the OWNLY Service, and that the borrower's use of those items will not infringe any other party's rights;</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>(b) you deliver any hired items to the borrower in accordance with the agreement you reach with the borrower;</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>(c) any descriptions of the items you advertise for hire through the OWNLY Service are accurate and include all information relevant to the use of the item, including (as appropriate): (i) notice of any defects, restrictions or other requirements that may apply to the use of the item; and (ii) any instructions or notices that may reasonably be required to use the item safely;</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>(d) the items you advertise on the OWNLY Service: (i) conform in all material respects to any pictures or descriptions that you upload to the OWNLY Service; (ii) are safe to use in accordance with any reasonable instructions that you provide to the borrower; (iii) are fit for any purpose for which such items would normally be used, or any purpose communicated to you by the borrower; (iv) can be legally offered for hire.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>(e) any rental item is only handed over to the borrower after the transaction(s) are approved by the OWNLY Verification process. You must only handover the item to the person verified by OWNLY, no third parties.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>1.4 If you offer storage space for hire, you must also ensure that the space is accessible safely and legally, that it is secure and free from leaks and/or excessive heat or cold. You will be responsible for any damage to any of the buyer's items that are left in your storage area.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>1.5 You will be responsible for any damage the borrower or any other person may suffer as a result of any defect in the item they have borrowed from you, or for any failure to comply with the requirements.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>1.6 You are free to agree any other terms on which you hire an item to a borrower, including the price you wish to charge to the borrower for hiring your item for the relevant hire period (the "Hire Fee"). When you post items for hire on the OWNLY Service, you must ensure that the Hire Fee you advertise on your listing is the total price payable for hiring your items, including any applicable taxes or costs of delivery.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>1.6 Upon return, it is your responsibility to ensure your item is not damaged or broken (except for any wear and tear) and only then close the request. If not, you need to click pictures and record videos, clearly depicting the issue with proper time stamps and only then contact customer support.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>1.7 Once you agree on the terms on which you will lend an item to a borrower, you must not try to amend those terms (including the price) unless you have a valid, justifiable reason for doing so and the borrower agrees to those amended terms.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>1.8 You can remove a listing or cancel your agreement to lend an item to a borrower at any time up to 48 hours before the start of the relevant hire period. If you cancel an agreement to hire an item to a borrower less than 48 hours before the start of the hire period, we may charge you a cancellation fee equal to 30% of the relevant Hire Fee.</p>
      <p className='TC__subheading'>2 Borrower Specific Terms</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>1 This paragraph applies to you if you are a borrower.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>2 When you agree to hire an item with a lender, the lender grants you a limited right to use that item for the relevant hire period. This right is personal to you and you are not allowed to give this right to any other person.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>3 You are responsible for ensuring that:</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>(a)  you are legally allowed to use any item that you borrow through the OWNLY Service;</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>(b)  you should do a proper quality check before receiving the item, any complaints regarding the item not working later will not be entertained, and you will be responsible for any damages/ breakage/ issues with the product.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>(c)  you comply with all applicable laws when using the item;</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>(d)  you comply with any reasonable directions provided by the lender to use the item safely;</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>(e)  you return the item in the same condition as it was when you collected it from the lender (any reasonable wear and tear excepted), or else youâ€™ll be charged to make up for the damage.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>4. You are free to agree with the lender how you will return any items you have hired the lender; however, you must ensure that return any items you have hired to the lender before your hire period ends.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>5. You will be responsible for any loss of or damage to the item you have hired.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>6. You must check all the defects and ensure the quality of the item before taking it with you.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>1.1 This paragraph applies to you if you are a lender.</p>
      <p className='TC__subheading'>5. Fees and payment</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>1. If you are a lender, we will collect the Hire Fee from the borrower on your behalf. Unless we are unable to obtain payment from the borrower, such as where a buyer's payment method is refused or our payment services provider determines that there is a risk of fraud, we will transfer you the Hire Fee within 24 hours of the start date of the rental. We will also charge you a fee of 15% of the Hire Fee ("Lender Fee"), which we will deduct from the amount we transfer to you.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>2. If you are a borrower, once you have agreed to hire an item from the lender, we will charge you the full Hire Fee on the lender's behalf. In addition to the Hire Fee, we will also charge you an additional fee for your use of the OWNLY Service equal to 5% of the price you pay to the lender to hire an item (" borrower Fee").</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>3. When you create your Account, you will need to provide us with valid, up-to-date and complete credit or debit card details. When you agree to borrow or buy an item, you authorise us to charge such credit or debit card for the relevant Hire Fee and Borrower Fee or Sale Price and Buyer Fee and hereby confirm that the details you provide are accurate and that you have the right to use the payment method selected.</p>
      <p className='TC__text'>4. If we are unsuccessful in charging the Hire Fee, Borrower Fee, Sale Price, Buyer Fee, Late Fee, Settlement Fee or any other amount to your credit or debit card, and have still not received payment within 7 days after informing you, we may suspend or temporarily disable all or part of your access to the OWNLY Service (without any responsibility to you), and we shall be under no obligation to provide any or all of the OWNLY Service while the amount concerned is unpaid. This does not affect any other rights and remedies available to us or the lender. If you chargeback a payment you were obliged to pay by the terms of this agreement, your account will be immediately suspended until the payment is re-paid, or the chargeback is cancelled.</p>
